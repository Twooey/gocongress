## Configuration

`ENV` variables are stored in a `.env` file, which is git-ignored.
Most of these variables don't belong in source control because they
are secret. Others vary by deployment level. This file will be
loaded by the `dotenv` gem.

For local development, `cp .env.example .env` to get started.
For `stage` and `production` use [heroku config][2].
